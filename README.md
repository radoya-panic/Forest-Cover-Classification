## About
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Skill Path 'Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow'. I use the python library called Keras - which allows for an interface between python and tensorflow.

The purpose of this model is to predict forest cover type based only on cartographic variables. The project stages consisted of: exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, building various deep learning models, tuning their hyperparamters, and testing them.
